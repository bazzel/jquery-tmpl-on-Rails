Using the jQuery Template plugin in Rails

This is still experimental.

After reading http://blog.reybango.com/2010/07/09/not-using-jquery-javascript-templates-youre-really-missing-out/ I was eagered to find out if I could make this work in Rails. So I started this project, which at the moment:

 * Can display a simple AR model object in a table row (TR)
 
TODO:
 * Can I use
     =link_to 'Click me', recipe
   instead of
     =link_to 'Click me', recipe_path(recipe)
 * How about using expression/operators in a partial. Can I port them to jquery.tmpl (and do I want to)?
